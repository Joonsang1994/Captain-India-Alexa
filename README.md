# Captain-India-Alexa

This is my first alexa skill I created. It is an india based quiz game.

You can copy the code to get started on your alexa journey!

Place the lambd.js file in a aws lambda file. The code is written in node.js.

Make sure to follow amazon tutorials for a detailed understanding of alexa skills!
